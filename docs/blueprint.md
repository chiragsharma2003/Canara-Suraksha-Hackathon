# **App Name**: VeriMobile

## Core Features:

- Behavioral Data Capture: Capture and process behavioral traits, including typing speed, swipe gestures, tap pressure, navigation flow, and device handling. No persistent storage.
- Risk Score Calculation: Use a pre-trained anomaly detection model as a tool, based on collected behavioral data, to calculate a risk score for each session. Model should be updatable.
- Adaptive Authentication: Based on the calculated risk score, dynamically adjust the user experience. This could include prompting MFA or limiting account functions.
- Real-Time Feedback: Provide clear, real-time feedback to the user regarding their session's risk level and any triggered security measures.
- Secure Data Handling: Implement a secure data transmission protocol to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the behavioral data during capture and processing. No persistent storage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, security, and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and modern interface.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800) to draw attention to important actions or alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, known for its legibility and clean design; good for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, intuitive icons from a consistent set to represent different security levels and authentication steps.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout, focusing on ease of use and quick access to security-related information.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience and provide feedback during authentication processes.
