With the increasing adoption of mobile banking applications, traditional
authentication methods—like passwords, PINs, or even biometrics—are no
longer sufficient to protect users from sophisticated threats such as account
takeovers, session hijacking, or fraudulent transactions. Cybercriminals often
exploit compromised credentials or session vulnerabilities post-login.

To counter this, financial institutions are turning to Behavior-Based
Authentication (BBA) — a method that continuously verifies a user’s identity
based on behavioral patterns such as typing speed, swipe gestures, tap
pressure, navigation flow, device handling, and even geolocation trends.
