With the increasing adoption of mobile banking applications, traditional authentication methods—like passwords, PINs, or even biometrics—are no longer sufficient to protect users from sophisticated threats such as account takeovers, session hijacking, or fraudulent transactions andCybercriminals often exploit compromised credentials or session vulnerabilities post-login.

To counter this, financial institutions are turning to Behavior-Based
Authentication (BBA) — a method that continuously verifies a user’s identity
based on behavioral patterns such as typing speed, swipe gestures, tap
pressure, navigation flow, device handling, and even geolocation trends.

A social engineering tactic where an attacker assumes the identity of a trusted
individual or organization to deceive victims into divulging sensitive information
or performing malicious actions. This contrasts with cybersecurity, which
encompasses the overall measures and technologies used to protect systems,
networks, and data from various threats, including impersonation attacks.
Behavioral Traits That Could Reveal an Impersonator
App Usage Patterns
• What: Which features or screens they use most, and in what
sequence.
• Impostor giveaway: May access high-value features (like transfers)
directly, or in a different order than usual.
Time-of-Use Patterns
• What: Time of day or day of the week when the app is typically used.
• Impostor giveaway: Usage at odd hours or sudden spikes in access
frequency.
Session Duration and Pace
• What: How long they spend in each session or on each screen.
• Impostor giveaway: Rushing through screens, longer pauses due to
uncertainty.
Screen Orientation and Interaction Style
• What: Portrait vs. landscape use, one-handed vs. two-handed
behavior, tilt patterns.
• Impostor giveaway: Unfamiliar posture or frequent accidental inputs.
Network Environment Patterns
• What: Usual Wi-Fi/Bluetooth environments or known IP ranges.
• Impostor giveaway: New or suspicious network contexts (e.g., Tor exit
node, public Wi-Fi).
Audio Environment / Background Noise (Optional & Advanced)
• What: Consistent sound patterns in the user’s background (office
chatter, home noise).
• Impostor giveaway: Drastic change in ambient sound profile.
Device Behavior Anomalies
• What: Battery charging patterns, screen brightness changes, or
hardware sensors like accelerometer/gyroscope.
• Impostor giveaway: Different charging behavior, phone handling
angle, or even walking vs. stationary usage.
Interaction Speed Consistency
• What: Time taken between touches and transitions between screens.
• Impostor giveaway: Hesitation or overconfidence in navigation.
Voice or Spoken Commands (if voice input is part of the app)
• What: Tone, pitch, speed of voice commands.
• Impostor giveaway: Slight variations in phrasing or speed.
Clipboard & Input Method Patterns
• What: Whether the user types or pastes data, and what keyboard app
they use.
• Impostor giveaway: Copy-pasting credentials instead of typing, or
using a different keyboard.
